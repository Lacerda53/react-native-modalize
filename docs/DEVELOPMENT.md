# Development

If you want to add a new feature or fix an issue, you can run the _example_ folder to test your changes. Each example are using the local `Modalize` component from the `src` folder.

```bash
cd example
yarn
npx pod-install ios
yarn start
```

In another terminal, and still in the `example` folder:

```bash
yarn ios # or android
```
